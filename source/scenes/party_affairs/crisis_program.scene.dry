= Addressing the Economic Crisis

Our party is wracked as to how to deal with the economic crisis. From the centrist faction, Hilferding argues that the economic crisis must be allowed to play out, because it is simply a part of the cyclic nature of capitalism. [? if centrist_reform >= 3: Yet even within his own faction there are opposing voices declaring that the core principle of centrist Marxism is unity, not inaction. ?] [? if (centrist_reform >= 3 and fr_uk_seen and scandi_seen and austria_seen and comintern_seen and us_seen): Indeed, our efforts to forge bonds with socialist and communist parties all over the globe have inspired many to call for the formation of a United International. ?]

From labor, the economist Wladimir Woytinsky argues that we must pursue a massive public works program to reduce unemployment and stimulate demand, perhaps including deficit spending. His opponents, like Hilferding, argue that this plan will cause a return to hyper-inflation, and that it would not even help the economy. In addition, according to Hilferding, Woytinsky's strategy is opposed to Marxist principles. The so-called WTB plan, after its chief supporters Woytinsky, Tarnow, and Baade, is receiving more attention within the party.

However, leftists in the party argue that the WTB plan is merely a bandage over the fundamental flaws of capitalism. They argue that the crisis is an opportunity to end capitalism through massive nationalizations of industry, and finally bring our country to socialism.

Meanwhile, moderates and reformists draw up proposals for a limited plan of job creation through public works, funded through taxes, that does not involve deficit spending or large-scale restructuring of the economy. Labor argues that the plan is inadequate in its scale and ambition. [? if (neorevisionism >= 0 and eu = 0): Finally, the new Neo-Revisionist faction seeks to address the crisis by strengthening economic and political ties to other European nations in order to lessen the burden on ours. ?]

Woytinsky and the trade unions vehemently criticize the centrists for their policy. The workers are starving; are we going to callously abandon them and side with bourgeois austerity? On the other hand, the centrists criticize Woytinsky for promising the workers false hope; their position is that nothing can be done to alleviate the depression. They also speak of the fear of another round of hyperinflation that may result from deficit spending.

Our policy course is currently that nothing can be done to alleviate the depression.

@true_support

Only by through worker solidarity can we protect each other against capitalist depredations. Labor is somewhat critical of our efforts. The German workers are starving; are we going to abandon them while we chase an utopian dream? On the other hand, traditionalist centrists lambast their colleagues for sowing discord under the guise of promoting unity.

@plan_support

Our support of the WTB plan alienates the orthodox Marxists of the Centrist faction, and faces both opposition and support from a variety of sources across the spectrum. Leftists argue that the plan is flawed because it leaves capitalism intact, while some reformists are cautiously optimistic.

We have not yet convinced the party to formally adopt the plan. More work needs to be done.

@support_left_progress

We attempt to convince the party to support a program of mass nationalizations in response to the economic crisis. Leftists argue that this policy is in accordance with our long-standing socialist platform, while reformists and some trade unionists argue that the plan is unrealistic, and that we need to focus on more immediate improvements to workers' lives.

We have not yet formally adopted the plan. More work needs to be done.

@support_moderate_progress

We attempt to convince the party to support a moderate program of job creation without deficit spending. Advocates of the moderate plan argue that this plan is most likely to receive support from the bourgeois parties, and most practical in the immediate term. Opponents in the left and labor factions criticize the plan for being inadequate in its ambition.

We have not yet adopted the plan. More work needs to be done.

We attempt to convince the party to support the creation of a European Union. Advocates of the plan argue that this plan will distribute the economic burden more equitably and bring long-term benefits. Opponents in other factions criticize the plan for being impractical and a deviation from Marxist principles.

We have not yet adopted the plan. More work needs to be done.

@defer

We hold off on making a decision on economic policy, awaiting more information. Woytinsky and his supporters argue that inaction is a form of action of its own.
